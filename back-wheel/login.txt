Explanation for the onboard.jsx and login.jsx
State Management:

isLogin: Boolean state to toggle between login and signup forms.
formData: State object to hold the form data for email, password, and confirmPassword.
Form Handling:

handleChange: Updates the formData state as the user types in the form fields.
toggleForm: Switches between login and signup forms.
handleSubmit: Handles form submission and sends the data to the backend.
API Calls:

Uses axios.post to send the form data to the backend server.
The URL http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login or http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup is determined by whether the user is logging in or signing up.
Integration with Backend
Signup:

Frontend: When the signup form is submitted, the data (email, password, confirmPassword) is sent to http://localhost:5000/api/auth/signup.
Backend: The backend receives the data, checks if the user already exists, hashes the password, saves the new user to MongoDB, and returns a JWT if successful.
Login:

Frontend: When the login form is submitted, the data (email, password) is sent to http://localhost:5000/api/auth/login.
Backend: The backend receives the data, verifies the user, checks the password, and returns a JWT if the credentials are correct.
Potential Issues and Considerations
Server URL:

Ensure the server URL (http://localhost:5000) is correct. If the backend is hosted on a different server or port, update the URL accordingly.
CORS:

The backend should have CORS enabled to allow requests from the React frontend. This is handled by app.use(cors()) in server.js.
Error Handling:

The catch block in handleSubmit logs the error response. You may want to display these errors to the user (e.g., incorrect password, user already exists).
JWT Storage:

After receiving the JWT from the backend, you might want to store it in localStorage or sessionStorage for subsequent authenticated requests.
Validation:

Ensure proper validation and error handling both on the client side (React) and server side (Node.js/Express).
