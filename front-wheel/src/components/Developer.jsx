    Throughout my years, I have always fantasized about being the next Larry Page. After finishing high school,
    I had a bucket load of ideas about apps and software that I wanted to build and get rich. I built only a tiny fraction
    of them, spent more time than I expected, and still got 0 users; some even left unfinished, some succeeded.

    I even tried to build a startup that was to have Kenyan banks as the customer.
    A few years after my burnout, I restarted the journey differently after learning:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc px-8 text-lg text-black-500 mt-3">
    <li>I realized that no need to start from scratch, millions of templates already existed.</li>
    <li>After building, the real work begins: marketing and getting somebody to give you their hard-earned money.</li>
    <li>A good landing page shows professionalism, builds trust for B2B, and is a faster form of distribution.</li>
    <li>Collecting payments is key for any developer out there.</li>
    <li>Free trials kill projects and only work for VC-backed companies or large upfront investment.</li>
    <li>Only 3 out of 100 visitors buy your product!</li>
    <li>Waitlists and landing pages are gold time savers.</li>
  </ul>
  <p className="mt-3 text-lg px-6 text-green-500">
    I built LaunchSUV for many reasons but the key ones are:
  </p>
  <ul className="list-disc px-8 text-lg text-black-500 mt-3">
    <li>Save time and focus on what matters: building and promoting your business</li>
    <li>Get profitable fastâ€”the more you ship, the more you learn, the more you earn</li>
  </ul>
